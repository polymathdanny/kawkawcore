What is Kawkaw?
-----------------
Kawkaw is a blockchain that features assets and the ability to obtain cryptocurrency while playing games. While other cryptocurrencies use only Proof of Work(PoW), Kawkaw uses PoW and Proof of Play(PoP). PoP is a new way for gamers to participate in blockchain technology, simply by playing games. Until now, the minable cryptocurrency communities and gaming communities have been separated by a graphic card shortage. With Kawkaw, both these communities can come together and get a piece of the block. 

We aim to allow gamers to play their favourite games and at the same time earn Kawkaw as a reward. Majority of our developers have been gaming for years and have some exciting features to add within our gaming servers. How will we do it? Well... the beauty of PC Gaming and even console (Yes, we have a way to make this happen) is that modding is available to implement all the monitoring features we need to make our vision a reality.

Time after time we see blockchains popping up with no realistic goals or the work never carried out, this is why we provide a Proof of Concept on day one of launching. It's important to showcase our vision and how the barebones of the system will work and expand on this over the months and years.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/KawkawChain/Kawkaw/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Kawkaw Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------
Kawkaw Core is dedicated to ensure all new updates that are released will be thoroughly tested before entering the mainnet, this is why we have a testnet running alongside our main chain. While the testnet is running we will regularly run unit_testing that is built into Kawkaw Core and ensure all reports come back as PASSED.


### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
